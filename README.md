# Numerical PDE Solver — Heat Equation

This project implements numerical solutions to the 1D heat equation using finite difference methods.

The goal is to demonstrate understanding of:

- Discretisation of PDEs  
- Explicit and implicit finite-difference schemes  
- Stability and convergence  
- Numerical simulation and visualisation  

This work is part of my preparation for MSc programmes in Applied Mathematics / Scientific Computing.

## Methods Implemented

- **Forward Euler Explicit Scheme**  
- **Crank–Nicolson Scheme**  
- **Stability condition analysis** (Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition)
